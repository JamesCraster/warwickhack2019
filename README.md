# Talking 2.0
### WarwickHACK 2019

Send data using sound!

The user sends a message, which is converted into ASCII, which is then turned into morse code. The morse code is played out loud, which the decoder can hear and turn back into ASCII, then text.

The interface is built in React using Semantics UI. The encoder and decoder use the webkit AudioContext interface.
